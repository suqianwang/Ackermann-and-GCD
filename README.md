Discrete Structures for Computing


•	“gcd.cpp” and “Ackermann.cpp” is the function definition and declaration. They are just for reference, don’t run the main file with them.
•	For compile and run: just run the file named “main.cpp”. I output instruction in the file which is quite clear, so just follow the step.
•	Run the “main.cpp” one time, you get to implement two functions each for one time. If you want to get other testing results, run the file again. I didn’t put any loops because I don’t know exactly how you will test this.
•	output includes :
o	the value of the current arguments whenever the function is invoked.
o	the final result of each pairs of value.
o	how many times the function is invoked.
o	text instructions
